##Quick Recap
Required components for the electronics are:
1 Sensors(O2,Co2,Temperature,Pressure).
2 Logic Boards to run multi-parallel subsystems having one parent board (pi, uno, mega).
3 An LCD display (already selected link in drive)
4 Some robust buttons (can be designed by ourselves if needed to).
5 Led light strips(for lighting and other safety purposes).
6  A custom designed PCB for power distribution and other purposes.
7 For wires we'll try to go for silver lamination(more research required) or the standard wires as required by NASA.
8 Closure(made up of PEI) will consists of coils, and fans(links are in the drive) and may be sinks.


I2C is a very commonly used standard designed to allow one chip to talk to another. So, since the Raspberry Pi 
can talk I2C we can connect it to a variety of I2C capable chips and modules.
The I2C bus allows multiple devices to be connected to your Raspberry Pi, each with a unique address, that can 
often be set by changing jumper settings on the module. It is very useful to be able to see which devices are 
connected to your Pi as a way of making sure everything is working.
